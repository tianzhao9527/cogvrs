# Cogvrs Project

## Project Overview
This is a scientific-philosophical experiment project that explores "the feasibility of creating and observing Earth-like planetary civilizations through AI and programming."

## Project Goals
- Verify the feasibility of the simulation hypothesis
- Explore consciousness emergence mechanisms
- Create digital life with philosophical thinking capabilities
- Understand universal laws of civilization evolution

## Current Status
- âœ… Completed detailed project planning and design
- âœ… Project plan document: `Project_Plan.md`
- âœ… Created project structure and renamed to **Cogvrs**
- âœ… Updated all files with new branding and author information
- ðŸ“‹ Next: Begin prototype development

## Technical Architecture
- Seven-layer architecture: Physicsâ†’Environmentâ†’Lifeâ†’Societyâ†’Consciousnessâ†’Observerâ†’Experiment
- Main technologies: Python + AI + Distributed Computing
- Four-phase implementation: Infrastructureâ†’Emergence Verificationâ†’Consciousness Explorationâ†’Multi-universe Experiments

## Important Files
- Project plan: `Project_Plan.md`
- Working directory: `/Users/xubin/python/cogvrs/`
- Core code: `cogvrs_core/`

## Discussion Points
- Project evolved from civilization simulation to digital universe creation experiment
- Exploring philosophical dimensions of human ultimate meaning
- 4-year 50M investment feasibility
- Risk management for ethical and technical challenges

## Project Rebranding
- **New Name**: Cogvrs (Cognitive Universe Simulation Platform)
- **Author**: Ben Hsu & Claude
- **Domain**: cogvrs.com
- **Repository**: https://github.com/tianzhao9527/cogvrs

## Next Session Reminders
Continue discussion on:
1. Feedback and modifications to the project plan
2. Philosophical thinking about exploring human ultimate meaning
3. Confirming technical roadmap and resource allocation
4. Decision on whether to start concrete programming implementation
